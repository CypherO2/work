            <h5 className="">
              Welcome to my first blog, as a bit of an explaination as to why I
              started this: I was bored.Anyways! My name is CJ, you can call me
              that or by my online psuedonym 'Cassi', I am a chronically online
              individual, with experience in Web Development, Graphic Design and
              Full Stack Development, currently (as of writing this) I am 18
              years old! I am the owner/ creator of the discord bot Sgathach,
              whom was named for the trainer of "the Hound of Ireland: Cu
              Chulainn"!
              <br />
              <br />
              My psuedonym, 'Cassi', was originally derived as the shortened
              version of the name for a constellation, namely; Cassiopeia! It
              was originally used as my Minecraft username "SkyGodCassiopeia" on
              a modded Minecraft server, before people slowly started adopting
              the name and calling me by it - at the time I was known as
              "Cypher" a name I had been known as since my early days on
              YouTube.

            <h4 className="fw-bold">The Artistic Journey</h4>
            <h5 className="">
              Since my early days in primary school talking with my friends, I
              was enamoured with art, at first it was something I did to prove I
              was as good as others, a product of my insecurities after moving
              schools. I continued to draw and create differenct pieces of art
              all through my time in primary school and into secondary school,
              this continued until Year 8 (my second year in secondary school)
              when Covid-19 hit in Spring of that year.
              <br />
              <br />
              Throughout Covid-19 I had a benefit that no other student had; my
              mother was a key worker - an adult social care worker - meaning I
              was kept in school during the lockdown, where me and my siblings
              spent everyday for the period of time that was the lockdown.
              During this time, I practices and taught myself may different
              techniques and began that process of choosing my elective for my
              last 2 years.
              <br />
              <br />I ended up choosing primarily art tracks: 3D Design,
              Creative iMedia/ Graphic Design and Art, Craft and Design. In
              these courses I thrived, building the base upon which my future
              would be built upon; learning from professionals and building
              portfolios for examinations.

            <h4 className="fw-bold">The Binary Pilgrimage</h4>
            <h5 className="">
              I began my journey into the hell that is coding just a few short
              years ago, when I first started at my college on my T-Level
              Course: Digital Production Design and Development. I started out
              learning the basic and theory surrounding the world of coding as
              well as all the legistalation, copyright law and trademark
              problems - the issues that come with handling vast amounts of
              data; such as GDPR compliance.
              <br />
              <br />
              My first experience with a programming was funnily enough; HTML5
              during my time at secondary school - in the lead up to my
              enrolement to college to prepare myself for what was to come. My
              second experience was with python, the 1st language I was taught
              by a tutor, I became rather adept at the language, being able to
              work with databases and development enviroments at this people and
              now I even have a discord bot written with the help of the
              discord-py library.
              <br />
              <br />
              My next experience with a programming language was with C#, more
              specifically - OOP in .NET form applicationsthrough Visual Studio.
              The tutor for this also helped me to broaden my knowledge in HTML5
              before they left for greener pastures.
              <br />
              <br />
              In my second year at college, I began the process of learning
              React/ TypeScript paired with Full-Stack Development to create web
              applications on the fly. This was used in my final project for
              college; the 'Occupational Specialism' in which I was given
              70hours of supervised access to the internet to create a
              Full-Stack web solution to a brief; we had sections where we only
              had limited time to complete each section; 20 hours in Planning,
              30 hours in actual coding, 20 hours in Feedback and 2 hours in
              Evaluation.

              Coding and Art aren't my only interests, outside of them I have a
              vested interest in video games and general content creation,
              especially when either are carried out with my friends. In my
              free-time I enjoy playing games such as Minecraft, Terraria and
              Lethal Company with other and streamign them for the world to see,
              I also enjoy posting creating, editing and producing video for
              online platforms like YouTube.
              <br />
              <br />
              Additionally, I enjoy spending time in nature with my family,
              especially in the local wilds around me. I also spend my time
              tinkering with computer parts and other pieces of technilogy or
              vehicles such as bikes.
              <br />
              <br />I volunteer some of my free time at my local community group
              helping to manage magazine creation, joining in on project and
              events, and helping with the planning and/or function of events.

              art to code and anything else that catches my interest.
